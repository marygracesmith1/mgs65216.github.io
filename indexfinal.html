	<h1> <span style = "font-size: 20pt"; "text-align: center"> Collegiate Cheerleading: Peak Athleticsm </span> </h1>
		<p> The NCA Collegiate National Competition at Daytona Beach, Florida is the pinnacle of competitive and gameday style cheerleading at the college level. Every year, teams from all over the country travel to 
				Florida for the chance to win a national title; the UGA Competitive Cheerleading Team is no exception! My team works from August to April to perfect a routine to take to Nationals. We are the only competitive team
				representing the University of Georgia at NCA, so it's important for us to do well </p>
			<p>Collegiate cheerleading is divided into several different divisions. First, is the division: the division of the cheer team is based on the division of the school's football team, or basketball team if 
				the school does not have a football team. Next, they are divided into coed or all-girl, depending on if there are boys on the team or not. Then, from this division, we determine the size of the team. All 
				teams are limited to 20 people competing. So, large all-girl would have 20 girls and no boys, small all-girl is 15 girls or less, small coed is less than 4 boys and 16 girls, large coed is more than 4 boys.
				This may sound trivial, but depending on how many people you have available to tumble, stunt, or jump, you could do harder skills, so they want to make sure it is fair to everyone. Lastly, there are two 
				difficulty levels: intermediate and advanced. Intermediate schools do not do as difficult tumbling or stunting as advanced schools, obviously. So, for example, the UGA Competition Cheer team competes in the 
				D1A Intermediate Small Coed division. </p>
			<p> Once a team is categorized into a division and have their routine. They are ready to compete at Nationals. Teams arrive to Daytona the day before competition starts. We are given half an hour of practice
				time the night before the competition starts to perfect the routine. Practices the night before can be as late as 11pm, but extra practice will always be taken advantage of. Also, this practice is a great
				opportunity to familiarize yourself with the facility and the teams you will be competing against. The next day is the first day of competition. Each team goes to check in, then warm ups, then backstage, then 
				onto the floor to compete. After day 1 is completely done, the judges of the competition release a preliminary score sheet. The score sheet is important because it tells you what they want you to fix for 
				tomorrow's performance so you can get a better score. The process repeats the next day; once all teams have competed and the judges have deliberated, each division will be brought out onto the floor and 	
				the winners announced. The winners receive a trophy and a banner to take with them, along with the title of national champions. </p>
						
		<p> Winning NCA is the greatest achievement in the collegiate cheer world. A win there makes all the hard work worth it! </p>
